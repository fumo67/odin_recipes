            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda    </li>
            <li>½ cup ricotta cheese  </li>
            <li>1 large egg  </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin) </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil   </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar   </li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract   </li>
            <li>1 cup self-rising flour     </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter     </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice   </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour  </li>

        </ul>
       <h2>Directions</h2> 
       <ol>
         <li><b>Step 1</b> <br> Whisk together cold water and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, egg, lemon zest, vegetable oil, sugar, and vanilla; whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix.

         </li>
         <li><b>Step 2</b> <br>Whisk in 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour, melted butter, and lemon juice until most of flour disappears into batter. Let batter sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.

         </li>
         <li><b>Step 3</b> <br>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.

         </li>
         <li><b>Step 4</b> <br>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
